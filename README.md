# Pandwaita
## Icon theme based on GNOME Desktop's [Adwaita](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme/blob/master/COPYING) but with cute pandas cursors.

# Aknowledgements
* Non-panda icons artwork was created by the [GNOME Project](http://www.gnome.org)
* The panda icons were derived from [@danielmahon's](https://twitter.com/danielmahon) ["Panda Character"](https://opengameart.org/content/panda-character-32x32) artwork
